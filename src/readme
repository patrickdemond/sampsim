Coding standard
===============

Line Lengths
------------
No line should exceed 110 characters

Function (Round) Brackets
-------------------------
Control structure and function arguments are always separated by a single space and start/end with a space.
Also, there is never a space between the control structure or function name and opening round bracking.  For
instance:

my_function( arg1, arg2, arg3 );
if( test ) process(); // functions with no arguments don't need spaces

Curly Braces
------------
Curly braces are placed on separate lines (from code) and indented at the same level as their parent.  For
instance:

if( var < 10 )
{ // comments can go here
  for( i = 0; i < 10; i++ )
  {
    // do something here
  }
}

Naming Convension
-----------------
All namespaces, variables, classes, functions and methods use only lower case variables, numbers and
underscores.  For instance:

$some_object = new sampsim::my_class_name();
