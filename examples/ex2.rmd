## Sampling example 2

The goal of this example is to start showing how we can read sampled files into R for post-processing and evaluation of their statistical properties.

The goal:

* generate samples
* read samples into R
* estimate prevalence of disease
* run `glm()`, estimate various odds ratios, compare with truth?

```
./generate -c config/default_population.conf test 
 ## 13 seconds to generate, 13 seconds to write JSON (148M)
./strip_epi_sample --flat_file test.json strip
 ## ERROR: failed to parse population file "test.json"
 ## * Line 1354997, Column 1
 ##  Missing ',' or '}' in object declaration
```

But

```
./generate -c config/default_population.conf --batch_npop 10 \
            --batch_sampler arc_epi \
            --batch_nsamp 10 multi2
```
does work (generates 100 samples)

```{r}
library(RJSONIO)
readJSONStream(file("exdata/multi2.05.02.json"))
```
