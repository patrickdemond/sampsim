* BMB: re-make everything and make sure that README/instructions are clear
    * it's OK to have "installer" and "user" be different people
* BMB: re-run basic examples (these are more focused on visualizing raw output)
    * make sure everything still works and polish/clarify instructions etc.
* does the code (yet) have an option to output true (incidence, total N) for a city realization and observed (incidence, total N) for a sample realization?
* want to get the output in the format:
* simulate a city = "generate"
```
{var1-N} generate# {samp_type,samp_par1-N} trueN trueinc sampN sampinc
```
spit out a file

run# city# sample_N sample_I
