# Uncommenting this parameter will result in splitting each town into quadrants, then running the usual EPI
# "spin-the-bottle" technique from the centre of each quadrant.  The sample will be made up of N separate
# samples, one in each of the quadrants, such that the total sample will be divided evenly between all four.
