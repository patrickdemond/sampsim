# The number of towns to generate

towns: 1

#
# The Pareto distribution parameters defining the number of individuals in each town of the
# population.  The parameters min will define the minimum value, max will define the maximum
# (truncated) value and shape will define the shape of the distribution's tail.
# The larger the shape parameter the closer to the minimum value populations will be.

#
# The width of each tile in kilometers

#
# The normalized trend coefficients used to determine mean population density of each tile
# Mean population density is a function of tile centroid position and is determined as follows:
#   P(x,y) = (b*mx/wx)*x + (b*my/wx)*y + b
# Where mx and my are the normalized population density trend coefficients, b is the base population
# density defined by the town's target population, wx and wy are the width and depth of of the town
# and x, y is defined such that the centre of the town is at # (0, 0).
# Slopes must be in [-1,1] and any values outside that range will result in an error.

#
# The number of disease pockets to generate
# The closer to a disease pocket a building is the higher the probability its inhabitants
# will have a disease (based on the selected picket kernel type).
# Disease pockets are randomly placed within the bounds of the population
#
disease_pockets: 3

#
# The influence function used by disease pockets
# This determines how the position of disease pockets affect the disease status.
# Possible values include exponential, inverse_square and gaussian
#

#
# The scaling used when determining the distance from disease pockets.
# For all pocket kernel types the distance is divided by this scaling factor.

#
# The trend coefficients used to determine mean household income
# Mean income is a function of position and is determined as follows:
#   mI(x,y) = b00 + b01*x + b10*y + b02*x^2 + b20*y^2 + b11*x*y
# The default values for b00 is 1 and 0 for all other coefficients

#
# The trend coefficients used to determine the standard deviation of the household income
# Standard deviation of income is a function of position and is determined as follows:
#   sdI(x,y) = b00 + b01*x + b10*y + b02*x^2 + b20*y^2 + b11*x*y
# The default values for b00 is 1 and 0 for all other coefficients

# Mean disease is a function of position and is determined as follows:
