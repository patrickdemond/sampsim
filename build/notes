Specific information for building on bayes:


## copy project from bitbucket
git clone https://bbolker@bitbucket.org/bbolker/sampling-simulation-project.git
## set up a separate build directory as noted in readme
mkdir sampbuild
## go there
cd sampbuild
## (Bayes only) setup for more recent compiler
scl enable devtoolset-2 bash 
## as specified in readme ...
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../sampling-simulation-project/build
##
# now change CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release in CMakeCache.txt as specified
## as in readme:
cmake .
## 
## DON'T change CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:FILEPATH; version set by configure,
## CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:FILEPATH=/opt/rh/devtoolset-2/root/usr/bin/c++
##  appears to be OK
## as in readme:
make

Specific information for building on sharcnet:

## you may be able to just copy /work/bolker/projects/sampling/build
## if not, create a build directory and cd there;
## these notes assume it is a directory at the same level

## change compilers
## GCC notes for Kraken: https://www.sharcnet.ca/help/index.php/GCC
module unload intel
module load gcc/4.9.2

## Get JSON (>0.5) from Github and compile ...
git clone https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp.git
cd jsoncpp
mkdir -p build/debug
cd build/debug
cmake28 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug -DBUILD_STATIC_LIBS=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DARCHIVE_INSTALL_DIR=. -G "Unix Makefiles" ../..
make

## 'make install' fails because we don't have admin privileges
## for standard location
## manual install (probably a less ugly way to do this!)
cd ../..        ## get back to ./jsoncpp directory
mkdir lib
cp build/debug/src/lib_json/libjson* lib

cd ..    ## get back to build directory

## use cmake28, not cmake
cmake28 -G "Unix Makefiles" ../sampling-simulation-project/build/

## modify CMakeCache.txt as follows:
## need full paths for JSON ...
//Path to a file.
JSONCPP_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/work/bolker/projects/sampling/jsoncpp/include

//Path to a library.
JSONCPP_LIBRARIES:FILEPATH=/work/bolker/projects/sampling/jsoncpp/lib/libjsoncpp.so

## also change CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release in CMakeCache.txt as specified
## as in readme

cmake28 .
make
