How to build sampsim
====================

sampsim uses CMake (http://cmake.org/) to configure its build process.  CMake is operating system
independent, so in theory it should be possible to build this project under Linux, Windows or
Macintosh.  I strees the words "in theory" since it has currently only been tested and developed
under Linux.


Required Libraries
==================

CMake (cmake.org)
-----------------
There are plenty of pre-compiled binaries of CMake available on the website, or you can download
the source and build it yourself.  Also, many linux distros have it build into their package
managers.  I recommend trying this option first since it's the quickest and easiest to do.


JSON CPP (jsoncpp.sourceforge.net)
----------------------------------
You will need the jsoncpp development libraries.  You can download these from the sourceforge
website or install them using your distro's package manager (try package libjsoncpp-dev)


Building sampsim
================

1. Get a copy of sampsim.

2. Create a build directory somewhere OUTSIDE of the sampsim source code tree so as not to
   polute the repository.

3. Inside your build directory, run cmake:

   For linux: cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" /path/to/sampsim/build

4. Open the CMakeCache.txt file and change the following:

   CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release

5. Re-run cmake by typing "cmake ." in the build directory.  When it is done you should see:
   "Build files have been written to: ..."

6. You are now ready to build sampsim by typing "make".


Building documentation
======================

1. Install the following packages: doxygen gnuplot graphviz

2. Edit the CMakeCache.txt file, setting BUILD_DOCUMENTATION to ON

3. Re-run cmake in the root of the build directory, this will create a new directory named
   doxygen.

4. In the doxygen directory run cmake -P doc_makeall.cmake
