General description should be added here.

example
-------

Start by generating a population using the generate command:

./generate -c default_config test

This will create a single file, test.json, which can be read by the samplers.  It makes use of the
default_config file which is found in the build directory, or the aux directory of the source tree.
If you wish to generate two csv files instead of a JSON file (one for households and one for
individuals) then add the --flat_file option:

./generate --flat_file -c default_config test

Now sample the population using one of the sample commands:

./strip_epi_sample --seed 4 test.json strip

This will sample the population created in the previous step of size 1000.  Another file, strip.json,
which can also be read by the samplers (should you choose to sample the sample you just created).
Once again, if you wish to generate two csv files instead of a JSON file then add the --flat_file
option:

./strip_epi_sample --flat_file --seed 4 test.json strip

For more information and a list of all possible options use the --help option when running any
command.
