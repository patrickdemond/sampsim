General description should be added here.

example
-------

Start by generating a population using the generate command:

./generate -c default_population.cfg test

This will create a single file, test.json, which can be read by the samplers.  It makes use of the
default_population.cfg file which is found in the build directory, or the aux directory of the
source tree.  If you wish to generate two csv files instead of a JSON file (one for households and
one for individuals) then add the --flat_file option:

./generate --flat_file -c default_population.cfg test

Now sample the population using one of the sample commands:

./strip_epi_sample test.json strip

This will sample the population created in the previous step of size 1000.  Another file,
strip.json, which can also be read by the samplers (should you choose to sample the sample you just
created).  Once again, if you wish to generate two csv files instead of a JSON file then add the
--flat_file option:

./strip_epi_sample --flat_file test.json strip

Additionally, the generate command has a batch mode capable of creating multiple populations and
sample them multiple times using a single command using the --batch_* options.  For instance, to
create 10 populations using the default configuration use the --batch_npop option:

./generate -c default_population.cfg --batch_npop 10 multi

Population files will automatically be numbered.  To skip writing the population files but instead
sample them 10 times using the arc_epi sampler use the --batch_sampler option:

./generate -c default_population.cfg --batch_npop 10 --batch_sampler arc_epi \
           --batch_nsamp 10 multi2

This will create a total of 100 samples in the form "multi2.N.M.json" where N is the population
number (from 01 to 10) and M is the sample number (from 01 to 10).  The sampler will use default
parameters.  In order to customise the parameters which the sampler uses they must be placed in
a config file and read in using the --batch.cfg option:

./generate -c default_population.cfg --batch_npop 10 --batch_sampler arc_epi --batch_nsamp 10 \
           --batch.cfg sample.cfg multi2

For more information and a list of all possible options use the --help option when running any
command.
