# This is a sample configuration file used to set up population parameters for sampsim
# 
# No more than one parameter may be included per line.  Options with no values (flags)
# are set to true if found on a line alone.  For example:
# 
# verbose
# 
# Options with values must be separated by a ":" character.  For example:
# 
# seed: 1234
# 
# If an option includes only numbers, periods and commas (no other characters or spaces)
# then it will be inturpreted as an array.  For instance:
# 
# coordinate: 1.2,2.4,3.6
# 
# Anything proceeding a # is ignored as a comment.

#
# The Pareto distribution parameters defining the number of individuals in each town of the
# population.  The parameters min will define the minimum value, max will define the maximum
# (truncated) value and shape will define the shape of the distribution's tail.
# The larger the shape parameter the closer to the minimum value populations will be.

# The width of each tile in kilometers

#
# The normalized trend coefficients used to determine mean population density of each tile
# Mean population density is a function of tile centroid position and is determined as follows:
#   P(x,y) = (b*mx/wx)*x + (b*my/wx)*y + b
# Where mx and my are the normalized population density trend coefficients, b is the base population
# density defined by the town's target population, wx and wy are the width and depth of of the town
# and x, y is defined such that the centre of the town is at # (0, 0).
# Slopes must be in [-1,1] and any values outside that range will result in an error.

# The number of disease pockets to generate
