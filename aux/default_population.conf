# This is a sample configuration file used to set up population parameters for sampsim
# 
# No more than one parameter may be included per line.  Options with no values (flags)
# are set to true if found on a line alone.  For example:
# 
# verbose
# 
# Options with values must be separated by a ":" character.  For example:
# 
# seed: 1234
# 
# If an option includes only numbers, periods and commas (no other characters or spaces)
# then it will be inturpreted as an array.  For instance:

# The Pareto distribution parameters defining the number of individuals in each town of the
# population.  The parameters min will define the minimum value, max will define the maximum
# (truncated) value and shape will define the shape of the distribution's tail.
# The larger the shape parameter the closer to the minimum value populations will be.

# The width of each tile in kilometers

#
# The normalized trend coefficients used to determine mean population density of each tile
# Mean population density is a function of tile centroid position and is determined as follows:
#   P(x,y) = P0 * [mx*(x/wx) + my*(y/wy) + (1-mx/2-my/2)]
# Where P0 is the "base" density (total population of town divided by the total town area), wx
# and wy are the town's x/y widths, mx and my are the normalized population density trend
# coefficients.  Slopes must be in [-1,1].
# For my=0, setting mx=0 will result in a constant density and x=1 results in the density running
# from 1/2 to 3/2 of P0.  Setting both mx=my=1 will result in the first (1,1) tile having near 0
# density and the last (max,max) tile having near 2*P0 density
