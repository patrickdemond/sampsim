Algorithm
========================================================
Once a town has been selected for sampling the following algorithm is performed on that town:

1. determine width of squares based on user input "number of squares per side"^\*^
1. select random point in town and identify square, $S$, the point falls into
2. make a set of all unselected buildings, $B$, which fall in square $S$
3. if $B$ is empty then go back to step 2 (if this happens 1000 times then quit with an error)
4. select a random building, $b$, in set $B$
5. add all individuals^\*\*^ in all households in building $b$ to the sample
6. if number of individuals in the sample is less than the sample size return to step 2

\* "number of squares per side" is a parameter defined by the user when running the sampler and corresponds to how many squares there are along any one axis for all towns (eg: 10 would mean that every town is divided into $10 \times 10 = 100$ squares total since there are always exactly the same number of squares along the X and Y axes )

\*\* selected individuals may be restricted to children only, or one individual per household based on input parameters defined by the user

Sampling Weights
========================================================
Probability of selecting town $i$ is:
$$
P_i = P\big(\text{select town i}\big) = \frac{n_i}{N}
$$
where $n_i=$ population of town i, and $N=$ total population.
Strictly, it's number of buildings or households, but we ignore that, and assume the number of people per household is constant.

Probability of selecting square $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle\square}{j}$ is:
$$
P_{\overset{\scriptscriptstyle\square}{j}\bigvee i} = P\big(\text{select square}\ \overset{\scriptscriptstyle\square}{j}\ \text{within town}\ i\big) = \frac{n_s}{S}
$$
where $n_s=$ number of squares chosen within the town, and $S=$ number of squares in the town.
Since all towns always have the same number of squares we do not have to include $P_{\overset{\scriptscriptstyle\square}{j}\bigvee i}$ when determining sampling weights.

Probability of selecting household $k$ in square $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle\square}{j}$ is:
$$
P_{k\bigvee \overset{\scriptscriptstyle\square}{j}} = P\big(\text{select household}\ k\ \text{within square}\ \overset{\scriptscriptstyle\square}{j}\big) = \frac{1}{n_{i\overset{\scriptscriptstyle\square}{j}}}
$$
where $n_{i\overset{\scriptscriptstyle\square}{j}}=$ number of households in square $\overset{\scriptscriptstyle\square}{j}$.

Therefore the probability of sampling household $k$ is:
$$
P_{i\overset{\scriptscriptstyle\square}{j}k} = P\big(\text{select household}\ i\overset{\scriptscriptstyle\square}{j}k\big) = P_i \times P_{\overset{\scriptscriptstyle\square}{j}\bigvee i} \times P_{k\bigvee \overset{\scriptscriptstyle\square}{j}}
$$

Making the weight for household $i\overset{\scriptscriptstyle\square}{j}k$ equal to:
$$
\begin{aligned}
w_{i\overset{\scriptscriptstyle\square}{j}k}
  &= \frac{1}{P_{i\overset{\scriptscriptstyle\square}{j}k}} \\
  &= \frac{1}{P_i \times P_{k\bigvee \overset{\scriptscriptstyle\square}{j}}} \quad \Big( \text{since} P_{\overset{\scriptscriptstyle\square}{j}\bigvee i} \text{is identical in all towns} \Big) \\
  &= \frac{n_{i\overset{\scriptscriptstyle\square}{j}}}{n_i} N
\end{aligned}
$$
