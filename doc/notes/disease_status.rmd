The probability of disease status of each individual is determined by the following equation:

$$
P(i) = \frac{ 1 }{ 1 + e^{-\eta(i)} }
$$

where $i$ is a particular individual and $\eta$ is the sum of all wegithed factors:

$$
\eta(i) = \sum_{f} W_f Z_f(i)
$$

where $f$ represents each disease factor, $W_f$ is the weight for the disease factor $f$
and $M_f(i)$ is the normalized value for the factor $f$, for the individual $i$:

$$
Z_f(i) = \frac{ X_f(i) - \mu_f }{ \sigma_f }
$$

where $X_f(i)$ is the individual's value for factor $f$, and $\mu_f$ and $\sigma_f$
is the mean and standard deviation of all values for factor $f$.  In one equation this
resolves to:

$$
P(i) = \Bigg\{
  1 + exp \bigg[
    -\sum_{f} W_f \frac{ X_f(i) - \mu_f }{ \sigma_f }
  \bigg]
\Bigg\}^{-1}
$$

The six factors include population, income, disease risk, age, sex and pocketing:

$$
X_{population} \equiv N_{household}
$$
$$
X_{income} \equiv \ln\mathcal{N} \Big\{
  F_\mu() \big\rvert_{\boxdot},
  F_\sigma() \big\rvert_{\boxdot}
\Big\}
$$
$$
X_{income} \equiv \mathcal{N} \Big\{
  F_\mu() \big\rvert_{\boxdot},
  F_\sigma() \big\rvert_{\boxdot}
\Big\}
$$
$$
X_{age} \equiv
  \begin{cases}
    0,& \text{if child}\\
    1,& \text{if adult}
  \end{cases}
$$
$$
X_{sex} \equiv
  \begin{cases}
    0,& \text{if female}\\
    1,& \text{if male}
  \end{cases}
$$
$$
X_{pocket} \equiv 
  \sum_{pocket} 
  \begin{cases}
    e^{-d_p},& \text{if exponential}\\
    d_p^{-2},& \text{if inverse square}\\
    e^{-d_p^2},& \text{if Gaussian}
  \end{cases}
$$
where $\ln\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma)$ and $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma)$ are the log-normal and normal
distributions for mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, $F()$ is a spacial functions of
the form $F() = b_{00} + b_{10}x + b_{01}y + b_{20}x^2 + b_{02}y^2 + b_{11}xy$,
$F()\big\rvert_{\boxdot}$ is the function $F()$ evaluated at the centroid of a tile and $d$ is
the distance to the pocket $p$.
