Algorithm
========================================================
Once a town has been selected for sampling the following algorithm is performed on that town:

1. select random point in town
2. make a set of all unselected buildings, $B$, which are within the “sampling radius”^\*^ of the selected point
3. if $B$ is empty then go back to step 1 (if this happens 1000 times then quit with an error)
4. select a random building, $b$, in set $B$
5. add all individuals^\*\*^ in all households in building $b$ to the sample
6. if number of individuals in the sample is less than the sample size return to step 1

\* "sampling radius" is a parameter defined by the user when running the sampler and remains constant for all sampling circles across all towns

\*\* selected individuals may be restricted to children only, or one individual per household based on input parameters defined by the user

Sampling Weights
========================================================
Probability of selecting town $i$ is:
$$
P_i = P\big(\text{select town i}\big) = \frac{n_i}{N}
$$
where $n_i=$ population of town i, and $N=$ total population.
Strictly, it's number of buildings or households, but we ignore that, and assume the number of people per household is constant.

Probability of selecting circle $\overset{\circ}{j}$ is:
$$
P_{\overset{\circ}{j}\bigvee i} = P\big(\text{select circle}\ \overset{\circ}{j}\ \text{within town}\ i\big) = \frac{A_c}{A_t} n_c
$$
where $A_c=$ area of the sampling circle (all circles will have the same radius defined by the "sampling radius" parameter set when running a sampler), $A_t=$ area of a town (all towns have the same area) and $n_c$ is the number of circles chosen within the town.
The number of circles chosen will vary depending on the sampling radius and population density.

Probability of selecting household $k$ in circle $\overset{\circ}{j}$ is:
$$
P_{k\bigvee \overset{\circ}{j}} = P\big(\text{select household}\ k\ \text{within circle}\ \overset{\circ}{j}\big) = \frac{1}{n_{i\overset{\circ}{j}}}
$$
where $n_{i\overset{\circ}{j}}=$ number of households in circle $\overset{\circ}{j}$.

Therefore the probability of sampling household $k$ is:
$$
P_{i\overset{\circ}{j}k} = P\big(\text{select household}\ i\overset{\circ}{j}k\big) = P_i \times P_{\overset{\circ}{j}\bigvee i} \times P_{k\bigvee \overset{\circ}{j}}
$$

Making the weight for household $i\overset{\circ}{j}k$ equal to:
$$
\begin{aligned}
w_{i\overset{\circ}{j}k}
  &= \Big[ P_{i\overset{\circ}{j}k} \Big]^{-1} \\
  &= \Big[ P_i \times P_{\overset{\circ}{j}\bigvee i} \times P_{k\bigvee \overset{\circ}{j}} \Big]^{-1} \\
  &= \frac{n_{i\overset{\circ}{j}}NA_t}{n_in_cA_c}
\end{aligned}
$$
where $n_{i\overset{\circ}{j}}=$ number of households in circle $\overset{\circ}{j}$,
  $n_i=$ population of town i, 
  $n_c$ is the number of circles chosen within the town,
  $N=$ total population,
  $A_t=$ area of a town,
  $A_c=$ area of the sampling circle
